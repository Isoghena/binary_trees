A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.

Learning Objectives
===================

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
================

What is a binary tree

What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree

What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists

What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree

What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree

What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree


Requirements
================

General
---------------

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

You are allowed to use the standard library

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

All your header files should be include guarded
